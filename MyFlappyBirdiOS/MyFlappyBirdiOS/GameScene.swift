//SKScene: An SKScene object represents a scene of content in Sprite Kit. A scene is the root node in a tree of Sprite Kit nodes (SKNode). These nodes provide content that the scene animates and renders for display. To display a scene, you present it from an SKView object.

//SKPhysicsContactDelegate: An object that implements the SKPhysicsContactDelegate protocol can respond when two physics bodies are in contact with each other in a physics world. To receive contact messages, you set the contactDelegate property of a SKPhysicsWorld object. The delegate is called when a contact starts or ends
